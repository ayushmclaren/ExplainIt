# Day 1 : A Dip into Oil 
***

## Recent move in oil. [negative prices]

First of all, the markets are flooded with oil. Since the pandemic started, an estimated 30% of the world demand has perished while the output has majorly remained the same. Around April 13, Oil deal was announced. However, the cuts were much lower than expected and if you look closely within you’ll find it really isn’t as goody good as it sounds. Russia’s output has not fallen in years and it will continue to violate OPEC+ deals as it had been all this while, and the 2.5 mn cut Saudi announced was from a 11 mn baseline which it has never been able to sustain daily anyway, it’s average is around 8.5 which means the remains 2.5 was coming from inventories anyway. To sum it up, Oil deal failed to inspire confidence and offer the much needed respite. Now, Oil is traded in Futures contract, and WTI in particular is a physically settled futures contract. Most of the trade is a speculative one, therefore do not want physical oil, and refiners given the glut, no demand, tough transport conditions don’t want it either. Now, most of the WTI oil is delivered at Cushing, Oklahoma where you have to take delivery of the oil. Since the forward month was May, delivery was to be taken between 1st to 31st or else pay them to store. Some oil producers even want to induce Force Majeure. With this comes the expiry date for May’s contract, April 20th. Removing oil would be impossible cause after all its 1000 barrels per contract. Even Cushing is dangerously close to its capacity and is left with 2 weeks of capacity, and due to the dynamic nature of pricing the storage cost is now disproportionately high. Even the offshore containers near the African coast are not available. So much so that companies have now asked permissions to convert pipelines into temporary storage. The realisation hits the market and about 3 hours before expiry oil is dangerously flirting near \$0 levels. Panic starts to seep in, and within minutes we see oil has gone below 0\$. Anyone rolling over would have to pay as much as $60 (since when at -40 levels, June forwards were still trading at \$20). Hence people figured it’s better to pay someone to get rid of the oil contacts instead of the alternatives.

## Difference between WTI and Brent. Major Oil suppliers and importers.

First of all, WTI and Brent Crude are each major benchmarks for oil pricing. WTI is the main oil benchmark for North America, and Brent Crude is the International benchmark. WTI crude oil is sourced in North America, primarily from Texas, whereas Brent Crude is sourced from oil fields in the North Sea, near Norway. Brent has unlimited storage capacity for oil producers because it's produced at sea. The WTI crude is produced in landlocked areas, leaving producers vulnerable to running out of storage capacity. WTI forward contracts are settled with physical barrels, while Brent is a cash-settled forward. When the WTI contract expires, a quantity of oil that previously existed only on paper is converted into physical barrels that need to be used or else stored at a major U.S. storage site tied to the contract at Cushing, Oklahoma. Since nobody will pay you to take cash, a negative Brent value would not make sense. (Side Note - MCX cash-settled derivatives based on WTI were deeply affected as well, and BSE is testing negative prices now). Brent is an indicator for sentiment rather than a physical metric. Dated Brent would be a much more physical connecting benchmark. Both Brent Crude and West Texas Intermediate are light and sweet, making them ideal for refining into gasoline.
There has been a trend, due to advancements in oil drilling and fracking, of West Texas Intermediate becoming cheaper than Brent Crude oil. Prior to this, Brent Crude tended to be cheaper than West Texas Crude. This has been dubbed the American shale revolution.
